        <h2>In an effort to meet the evolving needs of financial planners as they provide guidance and advice to consumers on financial planningâ€¦  the ability to easily obtain the right materials at the right time in the right format is critical.</h2>
          <p>More specifically, in an industry predominately focused on printed materials, there needs to be an ability to distribute materials digitally in an easy to use and cost effective manner.</p>

        <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>

<ul>
<li>1 request from wholesalers, advisors, agents  provide Digital distribution of Kits</li>

<li>Allows for pre-meeting planning with clients to help tailor offerings</li>

<li>Access is immediate  vs waiting for shipment of physical kits</li></ul>

<strong>Reduce print and shipping costs</strong>
<ul>
<li>Over a 12-month period over 550,000 physical kits were ordered</li>

<li>The cost to get a kit into the advisors hands ranges from $6.76 up to $18.50 for print and fulfillment and $7 - $10 for shipping.</li>

<li>High number of orders are sent overnight to accommodate advisor needs for meetings scheduled with client</li>

<em>Advisors admit they "pitch"  most of the material shipped to them as they are only looking for key components until decisions are made to purchase products</em></ul></p>

          <p><strong>Savings opportunity example:</strong>
          <ul>

<li>Conservative estimates (lowest price kit) at a 5% adoption rate for digital distribution, the first year savings would exceed $207,000.</li>


<li>Consumers rely on the advice of their financial advisor</li>

<li>Financial advisors tend to have two or three products they recommend most often, which may not be our products. So "shelf space" is critical.</li>

<li>Financial advisors admit they do not use the complete kits producers provide to help them sell products to their clients</li>

<li>Advisors and consumers feel the standard kit, as it is delivered today, is comprehensive but also overwhelming.</li>

<li>Of the various options within a kit, advisors were most interested in only key elements, and if clients are unfamiliar with the company, they may want to show the financial stability sheet. The remainder of the kit may be good information for the advisors but not something they feel they would need to share with their clients.</li> </ul></p>
