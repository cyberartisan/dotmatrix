        <div class="row spacer">
          <div class="col-md-5">Character traits help convey the
            personality of our brand. Because we
            speak to multiple audiences and relay a
            variety of messages, we need to tailor
            our communication by showing different
            aspects of our personality. We do this by:
            <ul>
              <li>Choosing character traits appropriate
                to the audience<br>
                <br>
                <span class="exampleText">Example: A message for auto insurance
                policyholders would convey traits from the
                enterprise and business to consumer areas.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Giving added weight to character
                traits that best convey the message.
                Not all traits need equal emphasis in
                every communication<br>
                <br>
                <span class="exampleText">Example: A message for financial advisors
                about the services we provide may
                emphasize the traits of strong, authentic,
                empowering and confident, whereas a
                message to members about protecting
                their home may be more maternal,
                thoughtful and personal.</span></li>

                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Have a focused communication plan</strong>
                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li>Identify the message you’re trying to communicate.</li>
                      <li>Consider creating a simple outline before writing.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Deliver the right information at the right time in the
                    right way</strong>
                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li>Share only what’s most important and relevant at 
                        that time. Too much information will overwhelm
                        your audience.</li>
                      <li>There are many mediums for communication. Choose
                        the one that fits the content and the audience best.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Make content scannable</strong>
                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li>Be visual by using subheads, lists and graphics when
                        they can easily replace large amounts of text. This
                        will help readers scan important information quickly.</li>
                      <li>Be concise. Shed needless words and jargon. This
                        helps the message — and your audience — stay
                        focused.</li>

                <h4><strong>Account-level managed volatility</strong></h4>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Risk exposure adjusted for each individual investor

                  <li>Allows for personalization</li>
                  <li>May be slower to respond to changing market
                    conditions</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Fund-level managed volatility</strong>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Risk exposure adjusted uniformly for all fund
                    investors</li>
                  <li>More dynamic response to market events</li>
                  <li>Easier re-entry into the market when conditions are
                    more favorable</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Rationale:</strong> Using bullets and subheads to group
                information makes it easier to scan and process.
                </ol>

              <div class="col-md-4">
                <h4><strong>HOW IT SHOULDN’T SOUND</strong></h4>
                Managed volatility strategies can be applied at the
                account level, where the investment managers adjust
                risk exposure for every client portfolio they manage.
                While account-level strategies allow for personalization,
                a more effective approach is to apply managed volatility
                strategies at a fund level, where all investors in the fund
                are invested similarly. Managed volatility at the fund
                level allows for more dynamic movement to respond to
                market events quickly, both to protect investors during
                downturns and to re-enter the market when conditions
                appear to be more favorable for returns.<br>
                <br>
                <strong> Rationale:</strong>This much information is overwhelming when
                presented as one paragraph and would be much easier
                to scan in a list format.</div>

                Since the year 2000, the Nationwide Foundation
                has committed more than $345 million to charitable
                organizations like the American Red Cross, United Way,
                Feeding America<sup>®</sup> and Nationwide Children’s Hospital.
                Our associates are passionate about making a difference,
                too, logging 91,540 volunteer hours in 2014 alone.</div>

                <h4><strong>HOW IT SHOULDN’T SOUND</strong></h4>
                Because we’re one of the biggest and most powerful
                insurance and financial services companies in America,
                our products and support is the best in
                the industry.<br>
                <br>
                If building your business is important, call your
                Nationwide® wholesaler today.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Rationale:</strong> We lose credibility when we make unproven or
                pompous claims of “biggest” or “best.”<br>
                <br>
                A misspelled word [products] and improper verb usage [“is”
                should be “are”] make us look careless and unprofessional.<br>
                <br>
                In this context, the “if” language conveys fear. Instead,
                communicate how we help build their business.</div>

            Nationwide is one company offering
            a collection of solutions to meet the
            evolving needs of our members. All
            business lines within the enterprise

                Nationwide Insurance, Nationwide

                reference their old brand names in
                marketing communications. Business
                units should not display their names

            <p>A campaign is promotional and intended to engage our target audience quickly. It should share the brand’s
              DNA, but may carry a slightly lighter or more energetic tone. Campaign communications should create a
              buzz, increase awareness and spark interest. They typically have a short shelf life of 3 to 5 years.</p>
